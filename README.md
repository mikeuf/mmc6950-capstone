# Resource Scanner

## Purpose
Resource Scanner tests the current status of a list of internet resources the user provides. Whenever possible, it differentiates between invalid URLs and temporarily unavailable resources. A database stores the results for future checks, enabling changes to be tracked over time and distinguishing between permanent unavailability or transient outages. The user can configure the scanner to send email notifications upon analysis completion.
